Title: Kendall's Tau Partial Corr. for Survival Trait and Biomarkers
Version: 1.0
Description: We propose the inverse probability-of-censoring weighted (IPCW) Kendall's tau to measure the association of the survival trait with biomarkers and Kendall's partial correlation to reflect the relationship of the survival trait with interaction variable conditional on main effects, as described in Wang and Chen (2020) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa017>.
